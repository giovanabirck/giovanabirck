<p>With a multidisciplinary background in the artistic, cultural and entertainment industries, I have spent the past years specializing in, experimenting with, and researching Experience and Interaction Design. I learned to incorporate a holistic approach to my designs by implementing innovative thinking to solve complex problems.
